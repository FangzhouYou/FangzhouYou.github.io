<h1>Chen's home on the web, welcome!</h1>

<p>I’m currently a third year PhD student with computer science at Loughborough University, UK.\
My research interests are broadly in areas of Software Defined Network, Cloud/Edge computing, network resource orchestration, in-network computing, 
distributed system, mobile networks, kubernetes and P4.\
Prior to joining Loughborough Univeristy in 2019, I received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Xidian University, Xi’an, China 
and M.S degree in Electrical Engineering from TU Dresden, Germany. \
After that I worked in the industry (e.g., Infineon and Huawei Technology) for a few years.<p>
