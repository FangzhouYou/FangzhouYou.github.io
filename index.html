<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I’m currently a third year PhD student with computer science at Loughborough University, UK.<br>
My research interests are broadly in areas of Software Defined Network, Cloud/Edge computing, network resource orchestration, in-network computing, 
distributed system, mobile networks, kubernetes and P4.<br>
Prior to joining Loughborough Univeristy in 2019, I received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Xidian University, Xi’an, China 
and M.S degree in Electrical Engineering from TU Dresden, Germany. <br>
After that I worked in the industry (e.g., Infineon and Huawei Technology) for a few years.<br>
