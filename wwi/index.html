<h1>Working with me</h1>

<p>I've been working with UNIX systems for approaching 30 years.  I have therefore
developed a set of ways of working that are comfortable for me.  If
  you are a student of my you would do well to adhere to them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I use git and LaTeX.  You should too.</li>
  <li>I use emacs as my editor, you don't have to.
</ul>
