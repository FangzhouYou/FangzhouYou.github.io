PhDs with Iain Phillips
=======================

I get a lot of emails asking about PhD applications at Loughborough and
this page contains the things I would normally type in a reply. I've
collected them together so I don't have to keep retyping.

I'm willing to consider candidates from anywhere, but I can only
consider after an application is made. To do this please find the form
on the University Web-site and fill it in. If you're especially
interested in me as a supervisor mention my name on the form. Please
note that there are other people at Loughborough with similar research
interests to me, noteably: Professor Yang - Networks, Wireless Sensor
Networks and Control, Dr Lin Guan - network modelling and evaluation,
Dr Ana Salagean - Security and Coding.  Dr Posco Tso - data centres,
NFV, SDN.  Dr Amitabh Trehah - SDN, Graph Theory, Compact Routing.
Joint supervision is possible.

If you do email me, please tell me in that email who else you have contacted
at Loughborough.

I do not normally have funding for PhD places.  If a studentship
exists this will be advertised via the School website and
<jobs.ac.uk>.  If there is nothing there, then there is no point
asking for funding.

We will always take up references, so it is a good idea to mention to
your referees that they will be contacted shortly after your
application.  References from generic email addresses such as
gmail.com or yahoo.com are not usually accepted.

If you are particularly interested in a topic of research please provide
a short (say 500-word) summary. You will not have to researching this
area, but it will help us assess your promise as a candidate.
