CPHC/BCS Distinguished Dissertations
====================================

Many thanks for undertaking this review. I've tried to arrange it so
that each thesis gets three reviewers two nominated by the candidate and
one by the committee. Where there are more available potential
reviewers, I'm holding them as spare, so as to avoid over reviewing.

The BCS page for the competition is here:
<https://www.bcs.org/more/awards-and-competitions/distinguished-dissertations>

If the area of the thesis is outside your expertise, please tell me as
soon as you can.

If you feel you have a conflict of interest or are unable to review
for any other reason, then please tell me as soon as you can.

Please could you complete your review by August 1st 2019.  Short
extensions to this deadline will be possible.
