<https://www.bcs.org/more/awards-and-competitions/distinguished-dissertations>


For the reviewers
-----------------

If the area of the thesis is outside your expertise, please tell me as
soon as you can.

If you feel you have a conflict of interest or are unable to review
for any other reason, then please tell me as soon as you can.

*Please could you complete your review by August 1st 2019.  Short
extensions to this deadline will be possible.*

Format of review
----------------

This year we have streamlined the review from a single long document to a number of questions.  When you accept the review you will be given access to the review form which will ask:

* Please rate your expertise relating to the subject matter of the
  thesis.  (A choice of answers available on EasyChair).

* Which of the following statements most closely matches your view of
  the thesis?  (Again a choice of answers).

  * Please supplement your answer, e.g. by highlighting what in the
    work is ground breaking, explaining why this is one of the best
    theses, or identifying aspects of the dissertation that place it
    below the top of the field.   (Free text field).

* Which of the following statements most closely matches your view of
  the thesis accessibility to a non-specialist. (Again a choice of answers).

  * Please expand on your answer.  (Free text field).

* If you consider it so, please express in up to around 100 words why
  you consider it a winner. We may use this text in publicity
  surrounding the award presentation, should this thesis be the
  winner. If you don't consider this thesis a winner, then please
  leave feedback to the author as to why.
