CPHC/BCS Distinguished Dissertations
====================================

This page provides information for reviewers. Please bear with me, this
is my first year of chairing the committee and learning to drive
EasyChair for these purposes is taking time.

Many thanks for undertaking this review. I've tried to arrange it so
that each thesis gets three reviewers two nominated by the candidate and
one by the committee. Where there are more available potential
reviewers, I'm holding them as spare, so as to avoid over reviewing.

The BCS page for the competition is here:
<https://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1511>

If the area of the thesis is outside your expertise, please tell me as
soon as you can.

If you feel you have a conflict of interest, then please tell me as
soon as you can.

Questions
---

1. How long should the review be? 

   The aim of the process is to pick the very best thesis from those
   submitted; knowing that only the best have been submitted.  The
   review needs to be thorough enough for the committee to make the
   decision, concentrating on why this is excellent work within its
   field.  If you had to put me on the spot I would say 1000-1500
   words, but sometimes the message can be shorter, even down to 3-500
   words.

2. How is the decision made to select the best thesis?

   Each reivewer is asked to make a quantitative judgement on the
   scale:

    1. Although a nominated thesis, this does not meet the criteria
        for the award
    2. An excellent piece of work, but not at the top of
       the field
    3. An excellent candidate, worthy of a highly commended; An
       outstanding candidate for the award

    together with a reviewer confidence.  This information will be
    used by the committee to select the winning thesis.

Email to nominated reviewers
----------------------------

    Dear nominated reviewers for this CPHC/BCS distinguished dissertation
    competition,

    I'm sending you this message as you have been nominated by submitters
    to the CPHC distinguished dissertation competition as reviewer for the
    theses they have nominated.

    There are more details about that competition here:
    <https://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1511>

    I will be using EasyChair to manage the reviews (you will be
    subreviewers in their parlance) and sometime over the next week or two
    you may receive an invitation to submit a review.

    This email is a pre-warning of this.  We asked that all nominated
    reviewers agreed to provide reviews before the submission.  If you are
    not willing to review then please decline the EasyChair invitation.
    If you have a conflict of interest, for example, same institution as
    the candidate either now or at the time of study or a close
    relationship with the supervisor, then again please decline saying so.

    I've had to extract your email addresses from the documentation
    submitted with the nomination.  This has been a highly manual process
    so if you receive a review request for a thesis that you have not
    consented to review, please accept my apologies, but please also tell
    me, so I can see what I did wrong.

    If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

Email to committee-selected reviewers
-------------------------------------

    Dear all,

    I'm sending you this message as you have been suggested by the
    committee as suitable reviewers for at least one of these theses.  You
    may have already received an email from me on this topic, where you
    have been nominated by one of the submitters.

    There are more details about that competition here: https://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1511

    I will be using EasyChair to manage the reviews (you will be
    subreviewers in their parlance) and sometime over the next week or two
    you may receive an invitation to submit a review.  If all goes well, I
    will get this done this afternoon and you will received an EasyChair
    invitation from me.  It is possible that I won't need a review from
    you, so for completeness I will email all my review list when I've
    completed the EasyChair invitations.  I'm keen not to overload people
    with too many requests, so will be saving some of you for later.  The
    invitation email will contain deadlines and further information.

    This email is a pre-warning of this.  We asked that all nominated
    reviewers agreed to provide reviews before the submission.  If you are
    not willing to review then please decline the EasyChair invitation.
    If you have a conflict of interest, for example, same institution as
    the candidate either now or at the time of study or a close
    relationship with the supervisor, then again please decline saying so.

    If you are unwilling or unable to undertake a review, please feel free
    to decline the EasyChair invitation, if the option presents, or email
    me.

    If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
