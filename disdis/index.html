<h1 id="cphcbcs-distinguished-dissertations">CPHC/BCS Distinguished Dissertations</h1>
<p>This page provides information for reviewers. Please bear with me, this is my first year of chairing the committee and learning to drive EasyChair for these purposes is taking time.</p>
<p>Many thanks for undertaking this review. I’ve tried to arrange it so that each thesis gets three reviewers two nominated by the candidate and one by the committee. Where there are more available potential reviewers, I’m holding them as spare, so as to avoid over reviewing.</p>
<p>The BCS page for the competition is here: <a href="https://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1511" class="uri">https://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1511</a></p>

<pre><code>Dear nominated reviewers for this CPHC/BCS distinguished dissertation
competition,

I'm sending you this message as you have been nominated by submitters
to the CPHC distinguished dissertation competition as reviewer for the
theses they have nominated.

There are more details about that competition here:
&lt;https://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1511&gt;

I will be using EasyChair to manage the reviews (you will be
subreviewers in their parlance) and sometime over the next week or two
you may receive an invitation to submit a review.

This email is a pre-warning of this.  We asked that all nominated
reviewers agreed to provide reviews before the submission.  If you are
not willing to review then please decline the EasyChair invitation.
If you have a conflict of interest, for example, same institution as
the candidate either now or at the time of study or a close
relationship with the supervisor, then again please decline saying so.

I've had to extract your email addresses from the documentation
submitted with the nomination.  This has been a highly manual process
so if you receive a review request for a thesis that you have not
consented to review, please accept my apologies, but please also tell
me, so I can see what I did wrong.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

<pre><code>Dear all,

I'm sending you this message as you have been suggested by the
committee as suitable reviewers for at least one of these theses.  You
may have already received an email from me on this topic, where you
have been nominated by one of the submitters.

There are more details about that competition here: https://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1511

I will be using EasyChair to manage the reviews (you will be
subreviewers in their parlance) and sometime over the next week or two
you may receive an invitation to submit a review.  If all goes well, I
will get this done this afternoon and you will received an EasyChair
invitation from me.  It is possible that I won&#39;t need a review from
you, so for completeness I will email all my review list when I&#39;ve
completed the EasyChair invitations.  I&#39;m keen not to overload people
with too many requests, so will be saving some of you for later.  The
invitation email will contain deadlines and further information.

This email is a pre-warning of this.  We asked that all nominated
reviewers agreed to provide reviews before the submission.  If you are
not willing to review then please decline the EasyChair invitation.
If you have a conflict of interest, for example, same institution as
the candidate either now or at the time of study or a close
relationship with the supervisor, then again please decline saying so.

If you are unwilling or unable to undertake a review, please feel free
to decline the EasyChair invitation, if the option presents, or email
me.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
