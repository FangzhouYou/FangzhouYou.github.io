When writing academic work avoid using citations as nouns.  Don't say:

> In [12] Fred says the moon is made of cheese

say:

> Fred says the moon is made of cheese [12].

As a rule of thumb *if the citation is removed does the sentence still
make sense?*

Also avoid saying *the authors*, refer to them by name, e.g.:

> Smith says ... [12]

> Smith and Jones state ... [12]

> Smith et al. imply ... [12] etc.
