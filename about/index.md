Iain Phillips
=============

I'm a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at Loughborough University,
where I've worked for over 20 years as Research Assistant, Research
Fellow, Lecturer and Senior Lecturer. From Feb 2008 until July 2011 I
served as Head of Computer Science and as a result joined the Council of
Profs and Heads of Computing Committee. I was CPHC Chair from 2012-2014
then the Immediate Past Chair, then I left the committee.

In Academic year 2019-20 I hold the following external positions:

-   Member of the Board of the [BCS Acacdemy](http://academy.bcs.org)
-   Chair of the panel to decide the winner of the CPHC/BCS
    Distinguished Dissertations competition
-   Co-chair of the NGN group in the UK. (<http://coseners.net>)

And at Loughborough:

-   Director of Academic Staffing in the School of Science

My [official web
presence](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/staff/academic-teaching/iain-phillips)
is rather corporate, but lets you see some employment information and
also useful things like a publication list.

My research is based around the areas of [computer
networking](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/research/research-themes/netsys)
and high performance computing. 

I maintain a LaTeX class for writing reports, dissertations and theses
at Loughborough: [luthesis](luthesis).
