My [official web
presence](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/staff/dr-iain-phillips.html)
is rather corporate, but lets you see some employment information and
also useful things like a publication list.

My research is based around the areas of [computer
networking](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/research/groups/nccs/)
and high performance computing. I've recently joined the [quantum
systems group at
Loughborough](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/quantum-systems) as we
explore the face of computing and networking over the next 10-30 years.

I maintain a LaTeX class for writing reports,
dissertations and theses at Loughborough: [luthesis](luthesis).
