<p>My <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/staff/academic-teaching/iain-phillips">official web presence</a> is rather corporate, but lets you see some employment information and also useful things like a publication list.</p>
<p>My research is based around the areas of <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/research/groups/nccs/">computer networking</a> and high performance computing. I've recently joined the <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/quantum-systems">quantum systems group at Loughborough</a> as we explore the face of computing and networking over the next 10-30 years.</p>
<p>I maintain a LaTeX class for writing reports, dissertations and theses at Loughborough: <a href="luthesis" class="uri">luthesis</a>.</p>
