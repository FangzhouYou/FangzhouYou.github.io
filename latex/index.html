<h1>LaTeX questions and packages</h1>
<h2>reducing whitespace</h2>
<p>(Note that typing texdoc packagename on a Mac or Linux command prompt will give you futher documentation on these</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the title/titlepage - use the <code>titling</code> package</li>
  <li>Around headings use the <code>titlesec</code> package</li>
  <li>To format code listings <code>listings</code>
</li></ul>

<h2>Interword spacing after fullstops</h2>
<p>The eagle-eyed will notice that space between words is a different
  length to that between sentences.  LaTeX distinguishes-interword
  space from inter-sentence space by observing the full stop
  characters.  So an inter-sentence space is placed after every full
  stop.  However, there are exceptions and places where this is
  wrong.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the letter before the full stop is a capital then LaTeX assumes
  it is an acronym, think I.B.M. and NOT the end of a sentence.  To
    fix this use the \@. instend of a simple .</li>
  <li>If the full stop does not actually mark the end of a sentence,
  usually e.g. or in someone's initials I. W. Phillips.  Here put a \
  between the . and the following space.  This indicates that this
  should be an interword space.  You can also use a ~ character which
  makes the space the same size, but prevents a line break occurring at
    that point, which is often useful.</li>
</ul>
